The message **"Something didn't go as planned. No need to worry---undoing changes"** typically appears after a failed Windows update. Windows is trying to undo recent changes to restore the system to its previous state.

This issue usually occurs when an update installation fails or encounters an error. Here are steps you can follow to resolve this issue:

## 1. Wait for Windows to Finish Undoing Changes

First, give Windows time to complete the undoing process. Sometimes, it may take several minutes.\
Make sure the computer is connected to power to prevent interruptions during the process.

## 2. Force Restart the Computer (if stuck)

If the system is stuck for too long (e.g., more than an hour), you can try force restarting it:

-   Press and hold the **Power** button for 10-15 seconds until the system turns off.
-   Wait a few seconds and power it back on.

If the system boots normally after this, continue with the steps below to prevent future issues.

## 3. Boot into Safe Mode

If the issue persists after restarting, try booting into **Safe Mode** to troubleshoot:

-   **Access Advanced Startup**:
    -   Power off your computer by pressing and holding the **Power** button.
    -   Power it back on, and as soon as you see the Windows logo, press and hold the **Power** button again to force a shutdown.
    -   Repeat this 2-3 times until you see the **Advanced Startup Options** screen.
-   **Navigate to Safe Mode**:
    -   Select **Troubleshoot \> Advanced Options \> Startup Settings \> Restart**.
    -   Once the computer restarts, press **F4** (or **F5** for Safe Mode with Networking) to boot into Safe Mode.

## 4. Run Windows Update Troubleshooter

In Safe Mode, run the **Windows Update Troubleshooter** to fix any problems related to the failed update:

1.  Go to **Settings \> Update & Security \> Troubleshoot**.
2.  Click **Windows Update**, then select **Run the troubleshooter**.
3.  Follow the prompts and apply any suggested fixes.

## 5. Delete Pending Windows Updates

If the update still fails, you can delete the pending updates and try again:

1.  Open **Command Prompt** as Administrator (you can search for "cmd" and right-click to select "Run as administrator").

2.  Type the following command to stop the Windows Update service:

    ``` bash
    net stop wuauserv
    ```

3.  Then, stop the **Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS)**:

    ``` bash
    net stop bits
    ```

4.  Delete the files in the update folder by typing:

    ``` bash
    del %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore\*.* /s /q
    del %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution\Download\*.* /s /q
    ```

5.  Restart the services you stopped:

    ``` bash
    net start wuauserv
    net start bits
    ```

6.  Reboot your computer and try updating again.

## 6. Perform a System Restore

If the above methods don't work, you can try restoring your computer to a point before the update was applied:

1.  In the **Advanced Startup Options**, choose **Troubleshoot \> Advanced Options \> System Restore**.
2.  Select a restore point from before the issue started.
3.  Follow the prompts to restore the system to that point.

## 7. Perform an In-Place Upgrade or Reset

If none of the above works, you can perform a **repair installation** using the Windows 10/11 installation media:

1.  Download the **Windows Installation Media tool** from Microsoft's website on a working computer.
2.  Create a bootable USB drive and boot your computer from the USB.
3.  Select **Repair your computer** and choose the **Reset this PC** option, allowing you to keep your files while reinstalling Windows.

This should resolve any deeper issues with the Windows update system.

## 8. Contact Support

If the issue persists after all of these steps, you may want to contact **Microsoft Support** or visit a professional technician.
