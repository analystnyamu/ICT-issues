# SECTION TWO

If you are unable to boot into Windows and need to back up specific folders like **Desktop**, **Downloads**, and **Documents** using the **Command Prompt** from a recovery environment, you can use a USB drive or external hard drive as the destination for the backup.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Backup Folders Using Command Prompt

### 1. Boot into Advanced Startup Options

If your computer wonâ€™t boot normally, use the following method to access the **Advanced Startup Options**:

- Power on your computer and as soon as it begins booting, hold the **power button** for 10 seconds to force a shutdown.
- Repeat this 2-3 times, and on the next boot, Windows should automatically enter the **Advanced Startup Options** menu.
- From here, select **Troubleshoot > Advanced Options > Command Prompt**.

### 2. Connect Your External Storage Device

- Plug in a USB drive or external hard drive where you want to back up your folders.

### 3. Identify Your External Drive Letter

In the **Command Prompt**, type the following command to list all drives:

```{bash}
wmic logicaldisk get name
```

This will display all available drives. Your external drive will have a letter like E: or F:. Note the drive letter of your external storage.

### 4. Navigate to Your User Directory

You will need to navigate to your user's home folder where the Desktop, Downloads, and Documents folders are located. This folder is typically located at:

```{bash}
Copy code
C:\Users\YourUsername
```

To navigate to the folder, run the following command, replacing YourUsername with your actual username:

```{bash}
Copy code
cd C:\Users\YourUsername
```

### 5. Backup the Folders

Now, use the xcopy command to copy the folders to your external drive.

**Backup Desktop Folder**

```{bash}
xcopy C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop E:\Backup\Desktop /E /H /C /I
```

*  Replace E:\Backup\Desktop with the correct drive letter and folder path on your external drive.
     
    * /E copies all directories and subdirectories, including empty ones.
  
    * /H copies hidden files as well.
    
    */C continues copying even if errors occur.
    
    */I assumes the destination is a directory.
**Backup Downloads Folder**

```{bash}
xcopy C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads E:\Backup\Downloads /E /H /C /I
```

**Backup Documents Folder**

```{bash}
xcopy C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents E:\Backup\Documents /E /H /C /I
```

### 6. Verify Backup

After copying, you can use the following command to verify the contents of your backup:

```{bash}
dir E:\Backup
```

This will show you the directories and files that have been copied.

### 7. Safely Eject Your External Drive

After the backup is complete, make sure to safely eject the drive by typing:

```{bash}
wmic logicaldisk where "DeviceID='E:'" get name, volumename
```

Replace E: with your drive letter.
Once the process finishes, you can safely remove the external drive.

### 8. Exit Command Prompt

After the backup is complete, type exit to close the Command Prompt.

### Summary

Boot into Advanced Startup Options and open Command Prompt.
Use the `xcopy` command to back up the Desktop, Downloads, and Documents folders to your external storage.
Make sure to verify the backup and safely remove the external drive before exiting Command Prompt.
