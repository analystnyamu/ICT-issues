    "text": "2.1 “Something didn’t go as planned…\nThe message “Something didn’t go as planned. No need to worry—undoing changes” typically appears after a failed Windows update. Windows is trying to undo recent changes to restore the system to its previous state.\nThis issue usually occurs when an update installation fails or encounters an error. Here are steps you can follow to resolve this issue:\nStep 1. Wait for Windows to Finish Undoing Changes\nFirst, give Windows time to complete the undoing process. Sometimes, it may take several minutes. Make sure the computer is connected to power to prevent interruptions during the process.\nStep 2. Force Restart the Computer (if stuck)\nIf the system is stuck for too long (e.g., more than an hour), you can try force restarting it:\nIf the system boots normally after this, continue with the steps below to prevent future issues.\nStep 3. Boot into Safe Mode\nIf the issue persists after restarting, try booting into Safe Mode to troubleshoot:\nStep 4. Run Windows Update Troubleshooter\nIn Safe Mode, run the Windows Update Troubleshooter to fix any problems related to the failed update:\nStep 5. Delete Pending Windows Updates\nIf the update still fails, you can delete the pending updates and try again:\nStep 6. Perform a System Restore\nIf the above methods don’t work, you can try restoring your computer to a point before the update was applied:\nStep 7. Perform an In-Place Upgrade or Reset\nIf none of the above works, you can perform a repair installation using the Windows 10/11 installation media:\nThis should resolve any deeper issues with the Windows update system.\nStep 8. Contact Support\nIf the issue persists after all of these steps, you may want to contact Microsoft Support or visit a professional technician.",

    "text": "3.1.1 Introduction\nOtter.ai provides powerful transcription and meeting management capabilities by integrating with platforms like Outlook and Google accounts. This document explores what happens when Otter.ai gains access to your accounts, potential privacy concerns, and how to manage its permissions.\nWhat Otter.ai Does with Outlook/Google Access\n1. Integration with Calendar\n\nOtter.ai reads your calendar events to:\n\nAutomatically create transcription tasks for scheduled meetings.\nSend reminders to record or join live meetings.\n\n\n2. Reading Contact Information\n\nOtter.ai uses your contact list to:\n\nIdentify participants in meetings.\nSimplify the process of sharing transcriptions or inviting collaborators.\n\n\n3. Accessing Meeting Links\n\nOtter.ai scans calendar invites for meeting links (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams) to:\n\nJoin meetings automatically and record them for transcription.\n\n\n4. Syncing Email Notifications\n\nOtter.ai may read meeting-related email headers to:\n\nUpdate changes in meeting schedules.\nLink meeting invitations to corresponding transcripts.\n\n\n5. Saving Transcriptions\n\nTranscriptions and audio recordings are securely stored in your Otter.ai account and can be shared with participants if desired.\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Privacy and Permissions\nWhen integrating with your Outlook or Google account, Otter.ai typically requests permissions to:\n\nView and manage calendar events.\nAccess email metadata (e.g., headers, senders, recipients).\nView and edit your contact list.\n\nThese permissions are essential for Otter.ai’s functionality but can raise privacy concerns if over-granted.\n\n\n3.1.3 Potential Risks\n1. Over-Permission\n\nExcessive permissions could allow Otter.ai to access unnecessary emails or modify calendar events.\n\n2. Data Privacy\n\nSensitive calendar or email data might be processed, leading to confidentiality concerns in corporate environments.\n\n3. Data Sharing\n\nIf auto-sharing settings are enabled, confidential information might inadvertently be shared.\n\n4. Security Vulnerabilities\n\nUnauthorized access to Otter.ai could expose sensitive information stored in the service.\n\n\n\n3.1.4 How to Limit Otter.ai’s Access\n1. Review Permissions\n\nFor Google Accounts:\n\nVisit Google Account Permissions to review and revoke unnecessary access.\n\nFor Outlook Accounts:\n\nGo to Account Settings &gt; Apps with Access to adjust permissions or revoke access.\n\n\n2. Disable Calendar Integration\n\nIn Otter.ai, navigate to Settings &gt; Calendar and click Disconnect to stop syncing with your calendar.\n\n3. Check Sharing Settings\n\nEnsure transcript sharing is not set to “Public” by default. Adjust these settings in your Otter.ai account.\n\n4. Log Out Regularly\n\nRevoke session access from Otter.ai to prevent unintended access to your accounts.\n\n5. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)\n\nUse 2FA for both Google/Outlook and Otter.ai accounts to enhance security.\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Conclusion\nOtter.ai’s integration with Outlook and Google accounts enhances its functionality by automating tasks such as meeting transcription and collaboration. However, it’s essential to review and manage permissions regularly to maintain security and privacy. If you have concerns, you can limit permissions or disable the integration while continuing to use Otter.ai manually.",
