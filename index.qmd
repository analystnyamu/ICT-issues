# Introduction

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on dealing with common ICT issues. This guide covers various challenges in ICT and provides practical solutions for each.

# ICT Issues Overview

If you are unable to boot into Windows and need to back up specific folders like **Desktop**, **Downloads**, and **Documents** using the **Command Prompt** from a recovery environment, you can use a USB drive or external hard drive as the destination for the backup.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Backup Folders Using Command Prompt

### 1. Boot into Advanced Startup Options

If your computer wonâ€™t boot normally, use the following method to access the **Advanced Startup Options**:

- Power on your computer and as soon as it begins booting, hold the **power button** for 10 seconds to force a shutdown.
- Repeat this 2-3 times, and on the next boot, Windows should automatically enter the **Advanced Startup Options** menu.
- From here, select **Troubleshoot > Advanced Options > Command Prompt**.

### 2. Connect Your External Storage Device

- Plug in a USB drive or external hard drive where you want to back up your folders.

### 3. Identify Your External Drive Letter

In the **Command Prompt**, type the following command to list all drives:

```{bash}
wmic logicaldisk get name
```

This will display all available drives. Your external drive will have a letter like E: or F:. Note the drive letter of your external storage.

### 4. Navigate to Your User Directory

You will need to navigate to your user's home folder where the Desktop, Downloads, and Documents folders are located. This folder is typically located at:

```{bash}
Copy code
C:\Users\YourUsername
```

To navigate to the folder, run the following command, replacing YourUsername with your actual username:

```{bash}
Copy code
cd C:\Users\YourUsername
```

### 5. Backup the Folders

Now, use the xcopy command to copy the folders to your external drive.

**Backup Desktop Folder**

```{bash}
xcopy C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop E:\Backup\Desktop /E /H /C /I
```

*  Replace E:\Backup\Desktop with the correct drive letter and folder path on your external drive.
     
    * /E copies all directories and subdirectories, including empty ones.
  
    * /H copies hidden files as well.
    
    */C continues copying even if errors occur.
    
    */I assumes the destination is a directory.
**Backup Downloads Folder**

```{bash}
xcopy C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads E:\Backup\Downloads /E /H /C /I
```

**Backup Documents Folder**

```{bash}
xcopy C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents E:\Backup\Documents /E /H /C /I
```

### 6. Verify Backup

After copying, you can use the following command to verify the contents of your backup:

```{bash}
dir E:\Backup
```

This will show you the directories and files that have been copied.

### 7. Safely Eject Your External Drive

After the backup is complete, make sure to safely eject the drive by typing:

```{bash}
wmic logicaldisk where "DeviceID='E:'" get name, volumename
```

Replace E: with your drive letter.
Once the process finishes, you can safely remove the external drive.

### 8. Exit Command Prompt

After the backup is complete, type exit to close the Command Prompt.

### Summary

Boot into Advanced Startup Options and open Command Prompt.
Use the `xcopy` command to back up the Desktop, Downloads, and Documents folders to your external storage.
Make sure to verify the backup and safely remove the external drive before exiting Command Prompt.


# Common Errors in ICT

## "Something didn't go as planned...

The message **"Something didn't go as planned. No need to worry---undoing changes"** typically appears after a failed Windows update. Windows is trying to undo recent changes to restore the system to its previous state.

This issue usually occurs when an update installation fails or encounters an error. Here are steps you can follow to resolve this issue:

## 1. Wait for Windows to Finish Undoing Changes

First, give Windows time to complete the undoing process. Sometimes, it may take several minutes.\
Make sure the computer is connected to power to prevent interruptions during the process.

## 2. Force Restart the Computer (if stuck)

If the system is stuck for too long (e.g., more than an hour), you can try force restarting it:

-   Press and hold the **Power** button for 10-15 seconds until the system turns off.
-   Wait a few seconds and power it back on.

If the system boots normally after this, continue with the steps below to prevent future issues.

## 3. Boot into Safe Mode

If the issue persists after restarting, try booting into **Safe Mode** to troubleshoot:

-   **Access Advanced Startup**:
    -   Power off your computer by pressing and holding the **Power** button.
    -   Power it back on, and as soon as you see the Windows logo, press and hold the **Power** button again to force a shutdown.
    -   Repeat this 2-3 times until you see the **Advanced Startup Options** screen.
-   **Navigate to Safe Mode**:
    -   Select **Troubleshoot \> Advanced Options \> Startup Settings \> Restart**.
    -   Once the computer restarts, press **F4** (or **F5** for Safe Mode with Networking) to boot into Safe Mode.

## 4. Run Windows Update Troubleshooter

In Safe Mode, run the **Windows Update Troubleshooter** to fix any problems related to the failed update:

1.  Go to **Settings \> Update & Security \> Troubleshoot**.
2.  Click **Windows Update**, then select **Run the troubleshooter**.
3.  Follow the prompts and apply any suggested fixes.

## 5. Delete Pending Windows Updates

If the update still fails, you can delete the pending updates and try again:

1.  Open **Command Prompt** as Administrator (you can search for "cmd" and right-click to select "Run as administrator").

2.  Type the following command to stop the Windows Update service:

    ``` bash
    net stop wuauserv
    ```

3.  Then, stop the **Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS)**:

    ``` bash
    net stop bits
    ```

4.  Delete the files in the update folder by typing:

    ``` bash
    del %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore\*.* /s /q
    del %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution\Download\*.* /s /q
    ```

5.  Restart the services you stopped:

    ``` bash
    net start wuauserv
    net start bits
    ```

6.  Reboot your computer and try updating again.

## 6. Perform a System Restore

If the above methods don't work, you can try restoring your computer to a point before the update was applied:

1.  In the **Advanced Startup Options**, choose **Troubleshoot \> Advanced Options \> System Restore**.
2.  Select a restore point from before the issue started.
3.  Follow the prompts to restore the system to that point.

## 7. Perform an In-Place Upgrade or Reset

If none of the above works, you can perform a **repair installation** using the Windows 10/11 installation media:

1.  Download the **Windows Installation Media tool** from Microsoft's website on a working computer.
2.  Create a bootable USB drive and boot your computer from the USB.
3.  Select **Repair your computer** and choose the **Reset this PC** option, allowing you to keep your files while reinstalling Windows.

This should resolve any deeper issues with the Windows update system.

## 8. Contact Support

If the issue persists after all of these steps, you may want to contact **Microsoft Support** or visit a professional technician.
