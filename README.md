## Understanding Otter.ai Integration with Outlook and Google Accounts

### Introduction

**Otter.ai** provides powerful transcription and meeting management capabilities by integrating with platforms like Outlook and Google accounts. This document explores what happens when Otter.ai gains access to your accounts, potential privacy concerns, and how to manage its permissions.

**What Otter.ai Does with Outlook/Google Access**

**1. Integration with Calendar**

- Otter.ai reads your calendar events to:

  - Automatically create transcription tasks for scheduled meetings.
  - Send reminders to record or join live meetings.
  
**2. Reading Contact Information**

- Otter.ai uses your contact list to:

  - Identify participants in meetings.
  - Simplify the process of sharing transcriptions or inviting collaborators.

**3. Accessing Meeting Links**

- Otter.ai scans calendar invites for meeting links (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams) to:

  - Join meetings automatically and record them for transcription.

**4. Syncing Email Notifications**

- Otter.ai may read meeting-related email headers to:

  - Update changes in meeting schedules.
  - Link meeting invitations to corresponding transcripts.

**5. Saving Transcriptions**

- Transcriptions and audio recordings are securely stored in your Otter.ai account and can be shared with participants if desired.

### Privacy and Permissions

When integrating with your Outlook or Google account, Otter.ai typically requests permissions to:

- View and manage calendar events.
- Access email metadata (e.g., headers, senders, recipients).
- View and edit your contact list.

These permissions are essential for Otter.ai's functionality but can raise privacy concerns if over-granted.


### Potential Risks

**1. Over-Permission**

- Excessive permissions could allow `Otter.ai` to access unnecessary emails or modify calendar events.

**2. Data Privacy**

- Sensitive calendar or email data might be processed, leading to confidentiality concerns in corporate environments.

**3. Data Sharing**

- If auto-sharing settings are enabled, confidential information might inadvertently be shared.

**4. Security Vulnerabilities**

- Unauthorized access to Otter.ai could expose sensitive information stored in the service.

### Conclusion

Otter.ai's integration with Outlook and Google accounts enhances its functionality by automating tasks such as meeting transcription and collaboration. However, it's essential to review and manage permissions regularly to maintain security and privacy. If you have concerns, you can limit permissions or disable the integration while continuing to use Otter.ai manually.
